Points to Remmeber:
1. Use components folder ONLY.
2. Commit the changes thru github so that it will be visible to us.
3. Make sure that after changes you have to "Push " the changes in repo.
   for example: if i make changes then i will use push option and you have to use pull option so that changes will automatically done in your file/device too.
